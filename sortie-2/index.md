## Overview
This is our second sortie, it is expected that you have  completed the first sortie [here](../sortie-1).

This second sortie is focused on learning the various formations available to us as combat fighter pilots, and to familiarize ourselves with their use. We will also cover maneuvers used as a flight.

This sortie may require a bit more practical preparation with a trainer, another cadet, or a willing friend. The skills in this sortie are very hands on in the cockpit.

Success in this sortie is not based on having a perfect formation, but instead of staying in formation, and performing quick rejoins when required.
