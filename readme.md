# What is this?
This is a UPT (Undergraduate Pilot Training) Program for a DCS Squadron. This syllabus is created by dotbmp and AngyCroc to serve as a unified basic training for all members of the 304th VFS. This training is a living document that will change over time to fit the needs of its users. Please feel free to use this program, or a program based on this in your own DCS groups.

## Why is this public?
We have decided that having this content publicly and freely available serves to help the greater DCS community as a whole. Instead of locking it away behind a membership, we would love to see every unit and squadron on DCS benefit and grow and become more collaborative. We hope that this information can be useful for anyone who is looking to take their group of people flying together, into a more organised group working together.
## Feedback
We appreciate and welcome feedback and improvements, please feel free to contact us via github or discord. Please be aware of the licensing requirements of this content.

## Classified information
We do not seek classified documentation, and we do not wish to use any classified techniques or approaches in anything that we do with DCS. We appreciate that military aviation is a topic of interest from people around the world, however we do base our methodology on that of the US Air Force, however this content could easily be adapted and tweaked to fit any organisation. However much of this content is based on guesses and may or may not match real life material. In situations where our processes may be similar to restricted or other sensitive information, it is purely by chance.

Do not send us classified materials, anyone doing so will be reported to the appropriate authorities immediately. This is stupid that we have to put something like this, but we are an international group, and we donâ€™t want anyone getting in trouble over our hobby.
