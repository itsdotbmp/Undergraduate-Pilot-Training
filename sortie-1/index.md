# DCS UPT - Sortie 1 - Basic Formation, with Ground attack Run in
## Sortie Overview
This is our first Sortie of the UPT Program for DCS. This sortie will be used as in introduction of information, it is learning heavy compared to the rest of the course. The goal of this first sortie is to set up a strong foundation for everything that follows.

The information provided here covers each of the areas to a basic level. Feel free to seek out additional information of any portion of this content. Please feel free to reach out to your Instructor Pilot (IP) if you are unclear or any areas.

You are encouraged and welcome to practice everything in this sortie as many times as you like. The general structure of this program is that you will set up a practice flight with your IP, and then a qualification flight where you would be graded to ensure you have an adequate understanding of the content. This is to ensure that you are understanding the important information so that you have a strong foundation for everything else we will cover.
