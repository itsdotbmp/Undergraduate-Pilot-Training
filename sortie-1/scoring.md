~~Passing score of 12 or better,~~ however proceeding on to the next Sortie is always at IP discretion.
Single Fail is a failure of the entire sortie and requires to repeat the sortie no earlier then 4 days later.

**Attendance:** If you are unable to make your planned flight time or need to reschedule your sortie, please do so by contacting your IP a minimum of 30 minutes prior to your planned meeting time. Failure to attend your sortie without notification, or being more then 10 minutes late for your planned time without notification to your instructor will count as an automatic failure of your sortie. In the case of a no show applicant, if no communications are received within 7 days, application will be terminated.
