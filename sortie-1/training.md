# DCS Undergraduate Pilot Training Program
# Sortie 1 Training Package
## About this Sortie
This is our first sortie of the DCS UPT Program, It will be used to assess where the Cadet pilot is in their skills, as well as begin introducing the standards of operations (SOPs) in the 3or4 VFW.

It is your responsibility, as a Cadet, to ensure you have reviewed this information and understand it before scheduling a sortie with your IP. If you have questions, or are unclear about anything, please reach out to an IP to get clarification or help. Grading criteria is available below for viewing. Flying with your fellow Cadets is a great way to prepare for UPT sorties, and we highly encourage it.

More information on our Training Program can be found [here](../training_program).

## Basic Communications
Communication is a fundemental part of flying as an organized group. The following outlines the structure of proper radio communication, use of plain language, Non-towered airfield communications, and inter-flight communications.


### Structure of Communications

The basis of most radio communications is the "ABC" structure. It is designed to make it quick and easy to understand. A. who is being addressed and by B. whom. Followed by C. which is the subject of the call. A helpful way to remember this is "A this is B, where is C?". Remembering that "B is me" will ensure there is no confusion as to who you are speaking to. 

> **A** this is **B**, where is **C**?

So now that we understand the basic structure, how does it sound in use? Here is an example:

> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON 1, Training flight of TWO A4s, Taxiing from APRON via BRAVO to RUNWAY TWO THREE RIGHT

**A.** Firstly, this call is to all traffic within the Nellis airspace. We will go into greater detail (here[#non-towered-airfields]) on non-towered airfield communication.

**B.** Secondly, the sender identifies the callsign of the flight, in this case TALON 1, this allows other pilots to know who is transmitting. Then, the sender identifies some key details about the nature of their flight as this is their first call on the frequency. Typically the number and type of aircraft the flight contains, and in this case, that it is a training flight.

**C.** Finally, the sender indicates that their flight intends to position for departure on runway 23R.

Lets take a look at another example:

> TALON 1, FLIGHT, check in 253

In this example, a flight has just executed a frequency change, and the lead pilot has made a call on that new frequency to confirm their wingmen have made the switch succesfully. Wingmen would reply with their number in the flight, such as "2", to acknowledge.

Let's take a look at one last example.

> TALON 1-1, Fox One, Mig-29

This call is different. It does not say who it is too specifically, it simply states the sender's callsign, and what they are doing. Talon 1-1 identifies themselves, then calls "Fox 1" as a brevity word to indicate they have launched a semi-active radar guided missile and the target is a Mig 29

This is an example of a brevity word used to convey an action, state, or request, in a quick and concise manner. A list of common brevity words can be found [here](../appendix/brevity), but for now, step by step instructions will be provided for most tasks a Cadet will be expected to perform.


#### A Note on Plain Language

While brevity words can be very efficient, sometimes an issue can not be fully conveyed without being more verbose or descriptive. Or the correct brevity word may not be known to the pilot. In these, and similiar cases, plain english certainly can be used, and is preferable to delayed comms, or no comms at all.


### Radio Etiquette

Just like using structure, brevity, and plain language to help us communicate clearly, we need to observe good radio etiquette so that everyone is able to communicate in a timely manner.

The basics of Radio Etiquette are, Think, Press, Speak

- Push to talk, not push to think
- Press transmit before you start talking
- Speak clearly and be concise. Say only what is necessary to convey your message.

Communications are the key to flying effectively as a group, but the reality of radio communication is that only one operator may transmit at a time. Another transmission at the same time renders both unintelligible, and a long transmission may leave others waiting to convey urgent messages. If you begin transmitting, but are unsure what to say, STOP. Think it through and begin again when the air is clear. Following the above guidelines will help to minimize your radio footprint, and ensure you are speaking in a standard format that others will easily understand. 


#### Break! Break!
An important brevity call you might hear on the radio is **Break! Break!**.

This signifies that an important transmission needs to come through, you are to pay attention and await the incoming transmission. Only once this transmission has come through should you then make radio transmissions.


### Non-Towered Airfields

DCS Does not have an indepth Air Traffic Control system, so to facilitate a safe and organized airspace we have adopted a Unified Non-Towered Airfield protocol (UNAP). Their are two key differences between the UNAP and a Towered Airfield protcols, the first is that in UNAP airspace pilots announce their intentions over the radio instead of making requests of an ATC Controller. The second key difference is noted in the difference of suffix, in UNAP airspace transmissions are made to TRAFFIC instead of TOWER.

Becuase UNAP airspace does not have a traffic controller, it is essential for all pilots to coordinate their movement both on the ground, and in the the air, to prevent unsafe conditions. Aircraft taxiing on the airfield must announce their intentions for movement, including their start location, destination, and approximate taxi-ways.

An example of a towered airfield radio transmission:
> NELLIS TOWER, TALON ONE, REQUESTING taxi to runway TWO THREE RIGHT

An example of an UNAP radio transmission:
> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON ONE, Taxiing to runway TWO THREE RIGHT


Pilots intending to land at an UNAP controlled airfield should announce their bearing, distance and type when entering the airspace at about 10-20 nautical miles from the airfield. On entering the traffic pattern of the airfield, pilots should announce the direction they are joining the traffic from, and which stage of the traffic pattern they are in. Pilots should continue to announce the stages of their pattern as they pass through them.

An example of an UNAP radio transmission announcing entry into the air space 10 miles around the airfield with the intention to land:
> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON ONE FLIGHT, TWO ship, 10 miles on approach for runway FIVE ZERO.

An example of an UNAP radio transmission announcing joining the pattern:
> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON ONE FLIGHT, joining upwind, Three-thousand AGL, runway FIVE ZERO.

Aircraft departing the UNAP airfield should announce their intended departure direction as such:
> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON ONE FLIGHT, departing NORTH

A common convention you may hear some pilots use is to repeat the recipient of the traffic call at the end, by wrapping your radio transmission with the location on both ends we ensure that it is clear which airfield the transmission is for when more then one airfield share a common frequency. This also provides pilots who may have truned in during your transmission to know critical information that they have missed at the beginning of the transmission. This is not a requirement, especially on shorter calls.

Operations)](https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_90-66B.pdf)


### Inter-flight Communication

Inter-flight communication is the name given to all communications between the aircraft that comprimise a flight. The flight adopts modified callsigns, removing the tactical callsign and using instead their position within the flight. The flight leader as DASH ONE, and wingmen will then be numbered DASH TWO, DASH THREE, and DASH FOUR respectively.

Most inter-flight communications will take place on a dedicated channel specifically used by the flight. By using an unique radio frequency a flight is able to protect the integrety of their transmissions. Inter-flight communication uses a simplified form of the ABC radio conventions, this is to assure that the radio frequency is held clear for time critical callouts between members of the flight. 

Common inter-flight communication is split in two rolls. Firstly the flight lead will make requests, and the wignmen will respond with their number, for example DASH-TWO will simply transmit the shortened reply "TWO".

An example of the shortened inter-flight transmissions between a flight lead and their wingman would sound like:
> Talon 1-1: TALON FLIGHT, left turn to THREE-HUNDRED

> Talon 1-2: TWO

> Talon 1-3: THREE

> Talon 1-4: FOUR

Wingmen are expected to communicate over the radio when significant events happen, these are not limited to but include: 
- SAM launch smoke trail, or ground fire tracers detected.
- Obsticles posing an immediate danger to the flight. 
- Malfunctions, or unexpected difficulties with the aircraft or manouver.
- Changes in aircraft state such as BINGO callouts or fuel state.

Most importantly when flying in formation wingmen should call out when they lose visual sight of the flight lead or aircraft they are following in formation (more on this is covered in [Sortie 2](../sortie-2/training))

Inter-flight communications may also happen on a non-interflight frequency, such as during landing operations. In these situations the flight lead will call for their flight to check in once on the new radio channel to ensure all members of the flight are tuned to the correct frequency. The same format will be used by the flight for checking in.

An example a two ship flight check in on 127.5 MHz:
> TALON FLIGHT, check in ONE TWO SEVEN POINT FIVE

> TWO

#### Helmet Fire

When pilots have too much radio traffic, the sounds of the aircraft, missile tones, RWR gear, and perhaps even intercom radio chatter from their back seat, we call this *radio fire*.

This is a condition where a radio operator is overwhelmed. In this situation the operator will need to start prioritizing information and will not be able to appropriately recieve or react to incoming traffic. It can quickly become a dangerous situation as the pilots ability to fly and assess threats is quickly overwhelmed.

It can be difficult to know if the pilot you are transmitting with over a shared frequency is in such a situation at times, especially because you may not be in that situation. However should you ever find yourself in this situation you will quickly understand why it is so critical that we follow these standards in our radio communications greatly simplifying the workload.

When experiencing helmet fire and dealing with critical situations in our aircraft, it is always acceptable to inform others on the frequency that you are dealing with something and that you need less helmet fire. And when you yourself hear such a request, treat it similarly to a *break! break!* or *hold traffic* command.
