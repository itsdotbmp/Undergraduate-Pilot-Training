# DCS Undergraduate Pilot Training Program
# Sortie 1 Training Package
## About this Sortie
This is our first sortie of the DCS UPT Program, It will be used to assess where the Cadet pilot is in their skills, as well as begin introducing the standards of operations (SOPs) in the 3or4 VFW.

It is your responsibility, as a Cadet, to ensure you have reviewed this information and understand it before scheduling a sortie with your IP. If you have questions, or are unclear about anything, please reach out to an IP to get clarification or help. Grading criteria is available below for viewing. Flying with your fellow Cadets is a great way to prepare for UPT sorties, and we highly encourage it.

More information on our Training Program can be found [here](training_program).


## Outline of Sortie 1
The Basic flight plan for sortie 1 is as follows:
- Basic communications
    - Structure of Communications
    - Plain Language
    - Radio Etiquette
    - Break Break
    - Non-Towered Airfield Communication
    - Inter-flight Communication
- Taxi and take-off
- Rejoin and transit
- Bombing range pattern
- Return to base and landing


## Basic Communications
Communication is a fundemental part of flying as an organized group. The following outlines the structure of proper radio communication, use of plain language, Non-towered airfield communications, and inter-flight communications.


### Structure of Communications

The basis of most radio communications is the "ABC" structure. It is designed to make it quick and easy to understand. A. who is being addressed and by B. whom. Followed by C. which is the subject of the call. A helpful way to remember this is "A this is B, where is C?". Remembering that "B is me" will ensure there is no confusion as to who you are speaking to. 

> **A** this is **B**, where is **C**?

So now that we understand the basic structure, how does it sound in use? Here is an example:

> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON 1, Training flight of TWO A4s, Taxiing from APRON via BRAVO to RUNWAY TWO THREE RIGHT

**A.** Firstly, this call is to all traffic within the Nellis airspace. We will go into greater detail (here[link]) on non-towered airfield communication.

**B.** Secondly, the sender identifies the callsign of the flight, in this case TALON 1, this allows other pilots to know who is transmitting. Then, the sender identifies some key details about the nature of their flight as this is their first call on the frequency. Typically the number and type of aircraft the flight contains, and in this case, that it is a training flight.

**C.** Finally, the sender indicates that their flight intends to position for departure on runway 23R.

Lets take a look at another example:

> TALON 1, FLIGHT, check in 253

In this example, a flight has just executed a frequency change, and the lead pilot has made a call on that new frequency to confirm their wingmen have made the switch succesfully. Wingmen would reply with their number in the flight, such as "2", to acknowledge.

Let's take a look at one last example.

> TALON 1-1, Fox One, Mig-29

This call is different. It does not say who it is too specifically, it simply states the sender's callsign, and what they are doing. Talon 1-1 identifies themselves, then calls "Fox 1" as a brevity word to indicate they have launched a semi-active radar guided missile and the target is a Mig 29

This is an example of a brevity word used to convey an action, state, or request, in a quick and concise manner. A list of common brevity words can be found (here[link]), but for now, step by step instructions will be provided for most tasks a Cadet will be expected to perform.


#### A Note on Plain Language

While brevity words can be very efficient, sometimes an issue can not be fully conveyed without being more verbose or descriptive. Or the correct brevity word may not be known to the pilot. In these, and similiar cases, plain english certainly can be used, and is preferable to delayed comms, or no comms at all.


### Radio Etiquette

Just like using structure, brevity, and plain language to help us communicate clearly, we need to observe good radio etiquette so that everyone is able to communicate in a timely manner.

The basics of Radio Etiquette are, Think, Press, Speak

- Push to talk, not push to think
- Press transmit before you start talking
- Speak clearly and be concise. Say only what is necessary to convey your message.

Communications are the key to flying effectively as a group, but the reality of radio communication is that only one operator may transmit at a time. Another transmission at the same time renders both unintelligible, and a long transmission may leave others waiting to convey urgent messages. If you begin transmitting, but are unsure what to say, STOP. Think it through and begin again when the air is clear. Following the above guidelines will help to minimize your radio footprint, and ensure you are speaking in a standard format that others will easily understand. 


#### Break Break
An important brevity call you might hear on the radio is **Break Break**.

This signifies that an important transmission needs to come through, you are to pay attention and await the incoming transmission. Only once this transmission has come through should you then make radio calls.


### Non-Towered Airfields

We do not have human ATC in our DCS Squadron, so we will be using Non-Towered Airfield protocols to coordinate with eachother when operating at or near airfields or carriers.

The first major difference with non-towered radio calls is that we suffix our calls with *TRAFFIC* instead of *TOWER*. The second major distinction is that they are announcements instead of requests, instead of requesting taxi, you are informing others that you are intending to do so. 

An example of a towered airfield radio call:
> NELLIS TOWER, TALON 1, REQUESTING taxi to runway TWO THREE RIGHT

An example of a non-towered airfield radio call:
> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON 1, Taxiing to runway TWO THREE RIGHT

It is important to note, because you do not have a person coordinating the actions of aircraft in the air or on the ground, it is your responsibility to coordinate with other pilots to ensure safe operations. It is not a free pass to do anything you want.
