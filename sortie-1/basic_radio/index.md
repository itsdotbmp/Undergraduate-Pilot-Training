# Sortie 1 - Basic Communications


## Communication Basics
Radio's are a Duplex communication form, someone is either transmitting or receiving. This means it is not possible to transmit or receive at the same time on a radio frequency.

Structured radio communication make it easier by allowing us to know what to expect in a radio transmission, which helps us over come bad transmissions due to interference. This helps us identify if we are missing information in a transmission.

### Structure of Radio Communication
The basic structure of radio communication is designed to make it quick and simple to know who is being communicated too, who is doing the communication, and what they are communicating about.
That structure looks like this:
> __A__this is __B__, where is __C__

An example of that structure with a real radio call could look like this:
> Talon 1-1: NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON ONE, Training flight of TWO A-4, Taxiing from APROM via BRAVO to RUNWAY TWO THREE RIGHT

Now lets break that down;

**A.**	Firstly this call is to all traffic within the Nellis AFB airspace on that frequency.

**B.**	Then we state that we are Talon-1 flight, what type aircraft we are and where we are, we will explain this further along in the [Non-Towered Airfields][Non-Towered Airfields] section.

**C.**	Finally, we indicate what our intentions are, we wish to taxi and depart to runway 23R.


### Plain Language
We use Brevity words and terse phrasing to minimize our radio footprint and communicate as much as possible as quickly as possible. However there are times where you may not understand what is being transmitted, or there is a need to explain something more complex. In these situations it is preferred to use plain language.

It is always acceptable to ask someone to say something in plain language, or to use plain language yourself. It is more important that the correct information gets communicated instead of trying to use Brevity or terse communication and fail to communicate the required information.

### Non-Towered Airfields
We have special considerations when we are communicating to a non-towered airfield, which is the default state for any airfield in DCS, unless a human is currently taking the role of Air Traffic Controller (ATC).

When communicating with a Non-Towered Airfield we want to ensure we are clearly communicating to other aircraft in the area the correct type of information. This allows everyone to coordinate with each other to avoid accidents.

The key points we need to communicate are:
- *WHERE*, which tower or airport the transmission is for. This can tell people if we are transmitting on the correct frequency, or if several nearby fields share a frequency.
- *WHO*, Who is making the call, if others need to respond.
- *WHAT*, A basic description of the type of aircraft, to help others visually identify who is making the calls.
- *LOCATION*, Where is the transmitter currently located, relative to landmarks or known positions.
- *DESTINATION*, Where is the transmitter planning to go.

After joining the airport frequency it is good practice to first monitor the frequency for a few moments to see if anyone else is currently transmitting. If there are other aircraft in the area, then we will need to coordinate with them to avoid any conflicts with our plans. We also do not want to cut off anyones transmission as we come onto the frequency.

Before taxiing, take off, or requesting to land we need check  that we are using the correct runway, and runway direction. This information can be found in the briefing, and by observing any windsock that may be present. Remember, we want to always take off into the wind (The small end of the sock pointing at us).

Once we have determined our route to the runway, or which runway we are landing on, we will transmit those intentions on the airport frequency.

An example Non-Towered transmission for Taxiing could sound like the following:
> Talon 1-1: NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON Flight of TWO, Type A-4 Skyhawk, At Apron, taxiing to runway TWO THREE RIGHT

This information allows the other aircraft on the frequency to plan, or call out possibly dangerous situations, such as another aircraft taking off or crossing a runway while we are performing a landing.

This protocol is also used when landing at an uncontrolled or non towered airfield, and follows the same points, it can look like this:
> Talon 1-1: NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON ONE FLIGHT, TWO ship A-4, 10 miles EAST, For Overhead Break, full stop, runway ZERO FIVE

We would follow this radio call up as we reached each stage of the landing, with call-outs at overhead break, turning crosswind, turning to base, and on final approach. We also want to transmit when we are clear of the runway.

### Inter-Flight Communication
As with communication with a tower, GCI, or other groups, communication between aircraft in the same flight is important to maintain flight coherency.

Inter-flight communication takes on an abbreviated form of the "*A, this is B, Where is C*"  format, with most transmissions being from the flight leader, and responses from the flight being in a terse format. In modern aircraft Inter-flight communication may take place on a dedicated channel, however in older aircraft where only one radio is available, it will take place on a shared channel. Therefore it is important to be clear and concise with commands and responses.

Flight lead may give a command such as:
>  Talon 1-1: TALON FLIGHT, left turn to THREE-HUNDRED

and expect terse a response such as:
> Talon 1-2: TWO
> Talon 1-3: THREE
> Talon 1-4: FOUR

Wingmen who lose visual sight of their flight lead, require further information, or who have important information to share, should communicate those things when it is safe to do so.

Possible examples:
> Talon 1-2: TWO, BLIND ONE 
> Talon 1 Wingman: Smoke in the air, 9 O' Clock
> Talon 1-3: THREE, ONE, Smoke stack Right ONE Mile

When the flight changes frequencies, the flight lead will instruct the flight to change to a new frequency. Then the lead will change to the new frequency, and start a check in of the flight.

An example a two ship flight check in on 127.5 MHz:
> Talon 1-1: TALON FLIGHT, Change to ONE TWO SEVEN FIVE
> *FLIGHT changes frequency* 
> Talon 1-1: TALON FLIGHT, Check in ONE TWO SEVEN FIVE
> Talon 1-2: TALON ONE TWO

### Helmet Fire

Helmet fire occurs when too much input is coming through to a pilot, sounds and warnings in the cockpit, radio chatter, and needing to respond. It is a colloquial way to refer to being overwhelmed by everything going on in their helmet at the moment.

We can reduce helmet fire for others by being aware of what is going on the mission at that point of time, and keeping our communications as clear and concise as possible.

When experiencing helmet fire yourself, it is important to prioritize and focus on what is important first. Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. It is not always possible for others to limit their communication further, but you will find it become easier to deal with helmet fire, as with many other parts of flying,  as you get used to your aircraft and the mission you are flying.

### Radio Etiquette
Proper radio etiquette allows for a smoother communication experience for everyone. It is important that we share the radio in a way that everyone is able to communicate effectively when needed. Remember, if you ever hear __Break Break__ it is a call out to stop any non-emergency radio traffic.

The basics of radio etiquette are, Think, Press, Speak:
- Push to talk, not push to think, plan what you will say before you start.
- Press Transmit *Before* you start talking. Encrypted Radios and digital radios will need an even longer pause before you start talking, otherwise you cut off the beginning of of your transmission.
- Speak Clearly and be concise, say only what is necessary to convey your message.
