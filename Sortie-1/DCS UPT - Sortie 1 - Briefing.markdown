### Outline of Sortie 1
	Basic Communications
Basic comms are a vital part of flying in a unit. We will outline Uncontrolled Airspace communications, Inter-flight Communications, and the structure of all radio communication.
	Taxi and Takeoff
What is expected during ground operations such as taxiing, what is a delayed takeoff vs a formation takeoff.
	Rejoin/Join-up and Transit
How do we get into a formation together, and how do we travel to our destination together, ensuring we arrive as a flight. 
	Attack Pattern
What is a ground attack pattern? How does it differ from a landing pattern. We will cover the basic ground attack protocol that all future ground attack is based on.
	Return to base and Landing
How do we get home, this covers navigations, formation flying and a very basic landing pattern. This landing pattern is based on general aviation patterns and is a foundation for many other things we will cover.

# Basic Communications
	**A** this is **B**, where is **C**?
Who I am, who Iâ€™m calling, what I want
	Plain Language
> ==When uncertain of the meaning of standard phrases clarify with plain language.==
It is more important that what you said is understood. However being as succinct as possible is also important. Every moment you are transmitting on the radio is a moment where no one else can communicate.
	Uncontrolled Airspace
Since we do not have ATC in most of our DCS missions we will use uncontrolled airspace protocols for communications in and around airfields, carriers, targets, etc.
This will sound like this;
> Nellis Traffic, TALON 1, Training Flight of two A4s, Taxiing to Runway 23 Right
This tells everyone where this traffic is for, who is sending the radio traffic, and what is going on. The important information here is that it is a training flight, and where they are going. This lets people know to expect the possibility of things possibly not being perfect with the flight because it is a training flight, so other pilots should pay a bit more attention and give more space.
	Inter-flight Communications
Communications between wingmen need to be clear and concise, at times you may be more relaxed, but when there is a lot going on, plus two or more radios, a WSO or RIO, it becomes pure helmet fire. It is important to understand what needs to be communicated and how to do communicate it clearly.
DASH 1, who is your Instructor Pilot for this flight, will ask for confirmation that your aircraft is ready to go. This will sound like:
> TALON FLIGHT, TALON 1, Check in
This is the flight lead asking their flight to check in. That reply would sound like:
> TALON FLIGHT, TALON 2, Green Jet, Yardstick Sour, Fuel 3 point 9.
This lets the flight lead know what the status of the flight is before the next stage of flight. A check in like this can happen during a flight as well, the appropriate information may change, instead of yardstick it might be weapons state, etc.
The information is
- Green Jet: The aircraft is started up, configured, no warnings or cautions, and the checklists are completed.
- Yardstick Sweet/Yardstick Sour: A TACAN Yardstick is often used. Between two aircraft to help judge distance and closure rates between aircraft. The A4 does not seem to have a functional ability to perform yardstick.
- Fuel State: This is the amount of fuel in the aircraft in thousands with a point and the hundreds. So 3900 is three point nine.
