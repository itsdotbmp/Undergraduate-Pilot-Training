# DCS Undergraduate Pilot Training Program
## Sortie 1 Training Package
### About this Sortie
This is our first sortie of the DCS UPT Program, It will be used to assess where the Cadet pilot is in their skills, as well as begin introducing the standards of operations (SOPs) that we expect to be used in our unit.

All of the training materials are open and accessable for anyone at any point, as well as our grading guidelines and instructor information. Please feel free to view any of this information to help learn the skills and processes that we use. Please note that some of these processes may differ from how they may be used in a specific airframe or situation, they are not intended to be completely accurate or fully encompassing, instead they are a foundation we use to build all other skills on. 

It is your responsibility as a Cadet to ensure you have reviewed this information and understand it before scheduling a sortie with your IP. We realize some of this information may be stuff that you already are familure with, we have tried to ensure that any important information is appropriately highlited. If you have questions or are unclear about anything please reach out to your fellow cadets or IPs to get clarification or help. We encourage cadets to practice the skilsl learned for these sorties together as well.

More information on our Training Program can be found [here](training_program).


### Outline of Sortie 1
The Basic flight plan for sortie 1 is as follows:
- Basic communications
    - Structure of Communications
    - Plain Language
    - Radio Etiquette
    - Break Break
    - Non-Towered Airfield Communication
    - Inter-flight Communication
- Taxi and take-off
- Rejoin and transit
- Bombing range pattern
- Return to base and landing


### Basic Communications
Basic communication is a fundemental part of flying as an organized group. We will cover the structure of proper radio communication, plain language, Non-towered airfield communications, and inter-flight communications.


#### Structure of Communications

The basic radio structure that we use is one based on a structure used by many organizations around the world. It is structured to make it quick and easy to understand who needs to pay attention, who is talking to them, and then message. The basic structure is:

> **A** this is **B**, where is **C**?

By remembering that *B is me* can help you remember this format. It will likely feel awkward or strange to use at first, but through practice it will become easier. If you mess it up you may find yourself being corrected, but we much rather you try and communicate and get it wrong then not have any communication at all.

So now that we see what the basic structure is, how does this sound like in real use? Here are some examples:

> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON 1, Training flight of TWO A4s, Taxiing from APRON via BRAVO to RUNWAY TWO THREE RIGHT

First this is a call is for Nellis Traffic, it is using uncontroled airspace communication where we do not talk to an ATC tower, instead we make announcements of our intentions to the radio frequency for that airspace. We will go into this in greater detail in the secion on [non-towered airfield communication](#Non-Towered Airfields).

Second, the IP identifies the callsign of the flight, in this case TALON 1, this allows other pilots to know who is transmitting.

Then we hear the IP identify what sort of aircraft is in the flight, and that it is a Training Flight. This information helps other pilots to understand what to expect from your flight, Helicopters move around the airspace differently then A4s or F4s. This also lets them know that it is a training flight, to give them a bit more space as they may need it.

Then the IP informs everyone listening that the flight will be taxiing from the apron to the 23R runway and which taxiway to expect them to be travelling on. This helps any other aircraft in the area to coordinate with your flight safely.

Lets take a look another example:
> TALON 2, TALON 1, Check in

This time we see that our IP is sending a radio transmission to us TALON 2. We know that it was TALON 1 that sent it to us, and they are asking us to check in. We will cover what this means in our inter-flight communications section.

One last example:
> TALON 1, Fox One, Mig-29

This call is different, It does not say who it is too specifically, it simply states the callsign of who is making the call, and what they are doing. This is an example of a Brevity Call. We will teach Brevity calls as they are required, so do not worry about trying to learn them all right now. However, this call tells us that TALON 1 has fired a semi-active radar guided missile, and we know that the target is a Mig-29. 


#### Plain Language

Brevity Codes, NATO phonetic Alphabet, and Radio Structure help us communicate quickly with eachother. However Plain language is always acceptable when you are unsure of the correct Brevity Call or phrasing, or need to explain something complicated.

It is always more important to communicate clearly then to get caught up in Jargon or codenames etc. We do however require use of the NATO phonetic alphabet. This limits the amount of issues that can arrise from the fact that many letters such as; b, c, d, e, f, and g, can all sound similar over a radio transmission. 

Here is a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) to wikipedia that can be helpful in learning the NATO phonetic alphabet.


#### Radio Etiquette*

Just like using plain language, brevity codes, and radio structure serve to help us communicate clearly, we need to observe good radio etiquette so that everyone is able to communicate.

The basics of Radio Etiquette are, Think, Press, Speak
 - Push to talk, not push to think
 - Press transmit *before* you start talking
 - Speak Clearly, say only what is needed

Think about what you want to say before you begin transmitting, who do you need to transmit to, which radio do you need to use, what do you need to communicate. Take a moment to organize your thoughts.

Then, press the transmit key, and wait a moment before you start speaking. Most radios might take a moment before they start transmitting after you press the key. Also ensure that you've pressed the transmit key before you start talking, so that you do not cut off the beginning of your message.

Once you begin relaying your message, keep it short and organized. There may be times where you are talking with eachother over interflight a bit more casually, but most of the time we reserve the air for important transmissions.

If you are transmitting, no one else is able to transmit, so you are blocking transmission for everyone else, even if they have an important transmission that needs to go out.

If you are transmitting and lose your train of thought, or need a moment. End your transmission, collect yourself, and when the traffic is clear, begin again. 


#### Break Break*
An important brevity call you might hear on the radio is **Break Break**.

This signifies that an important transmission needs to come through, you are to pay attention and await the incoming transmission. Only once this transmission has come through should you then make radio calls.


#### Non-Towered Airfields

We do not have human ATC in our DCS Squadron, so we will be using Non-Towered Airfield protocols to coordinate with eachother when operating at or near airfields or carriers.

The first major difference with non-towered radio calls is that we suffix our calls with *TRAFFIC* instead of *TOWER*. The second major distinction is that they are announcements instead of requests, instead of requesting taxi, you are informing others that you are intending to do so. 

An example of a towered airfield radio call:
> NELLIS TOWER, TALON 1, REQUESTING taxi to runway TWO THREE RIGHT

An example of a non-towered airfield radio call:
> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON 1, Taxiing to runway TWO THREE RIGHT

It is important to note, because you do not have a person coordinating the actions of aircraft in the air or on the ground, it is your responsibility to coordinate with other pilots to ensure safe operations. It is not a free pass to do anything you want.
