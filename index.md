# Undergraduate Pilot Training

Welcome new pilot. This is the UPT course overview with links to each part of the training. This training is split into distinct Sorties. Each sorry will have pass or fail components as well as portions that are designed to familierize you with new concepts. Our hope is that this training can be challanging but still enjoyable. The goal of this training is to create a foundation for all future development in our organization.

## UPT Framework

### Sortie 1
- Basic comms (understanding basic tower and flight communications)
- Rejoin and basic formation (understanding closeure to rejoin in an orbit and saddle on outside wing)
- Bombing pattern/mutual support (understanding shooter/support dynamic and offset dive bombing)
- Rejoin
- Basic approach (wide/civil pattern with seperation at base)

### Sortie 2
- Rejoin and basic formation
- Tacform (energy conserving manuevers to obtain spacing and basic wing and trail formations)
- Tac turns (recommend limiting manuever attempts to x3)
- Advanced manuevers
- Rejoin
- Approach to overhead (spacing at break and maintained through pattern)

### Sortie 3 (student flies element lead)
- Rejoin and basic formation
- Tac form
- Tac turns
- Bombing pattern/mutual support
