Welcome new pilot. This is the UPT course overview with links to each part of the training. This training is split into distinct Sorties. Each sortie will have pass or fail components as well as portions that are designed to familiarise you with new concepts. Our hope is that this training can be challenging but still enjoyable. The goal of this training is to create a foundation for all future development in our organization.
