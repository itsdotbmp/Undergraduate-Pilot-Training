### Outline of Sortie 1
	Basic Communications
Basic comms are a vital part of flying in a unit. We will outline Uncontrolled Airspace communications, Inter-flight Communications, and the structure of all radio communication.
	Taxi and Takeoff
What is expected during ground operations such as taxiing, what is a delayed takeoff vs a formation takeoff.
	Rejoin/Join-up and Transit
How do we get into a formation together, and how do we travel to our destination together, ensuring we arrive as a flight. 
	Attack Pattern
What is a ground attack pattern? How does it differ from a landing pattern. We will cover the basic ground attack protocol that all future ground attack is based on.
	Return to base and Landing
How do we get home, this covers navigations, formation flying and a very basic landing pattern. This landing pattern is based on general aviation patterns and is a foundation for many other things we will cover.

### Basic Communications
	**A** this is **B**, where is **C**?
	Plain Language
	Uncontrolled Airspace
	Inter-flight Communications
---
### 	**A** this is **B**, where is **C**?
Who I’m calling, who I am, what I want
This structure is used for all radio communications, and we have adopted it in DCS as well. It is a clear communication order that helps when radio traffic is high.
	What does that look like?
	> TALON 2, TALON 1, Where are you?
	
	> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON 1, We are two ship A4 Training Flight, Entering traffic from the north on a right down wind for runway zero one full-stop.
It may feel awkward at first but remember, B is me, and everything else will become easier with practice.

### Plain Language
When communicating over the radio, we often use Brevity codes for clear and concise communications. However in the end it is more *important* that clear communication happens. So never feel bad to use plain language when you are unsure on what something is called, or are needing to clarify something.
	If you are ever unsure on what to say or trying to explain something complex it is always best to use plain language.
	It is more important to communicate clearly then to try and use the correct terms in Brevity.

We will train you the Brevity language as it comes up, there is no need for you to already know it.

However we do require you to use the NATO phonetic alphabet, so it is good the familiarise yourself with it as soon as you can. This is due to the fact that letters like b, c, d, e, g, can all sound the same over a radio transmission.

### Radio Etiquette
	It very important to practice good radio etiquette, think, press, speak.
	- Push to talk, not push to think
	- Press before you talk
	- Speak Clearly, say only what is needed.

- Think about what you want to say or communicate before you start, take a moment to organise your thoughts. 
- Press the transmit button, there can be a delay before your voice actually starts transmitting, so it is important to wait a moment before you start speaking.
- Then start speaking, however remember, every moment you are transmitting on the radio, means no one else is able to communicate, so if you are struggling with words or needing a moment to think. Then release the transmit button and take the moment you need. Then when the traffic is clear, start again.

### Uncontrolled Airspace
	We do not have ATC in DCS we use uncontrolled airspace communications protocols to communicate our intentions.
These communications are an announcement over the radio for the other aircraft in the airspace to inform them of our upcoming actions. It is not a license to do anything you want, you still need to coordinate with other pilots and follow safe flying practices.
	Uncontrolled Airspace communications are suffixed with Traffic instead of Tower.
An example of a radio transmission that you may hear in todays sortie is:
	> NELLIS TRAFFIC, TALON FLIGHT is two A4’s training flight, taxiing from apron to runway two three right.

### Inter-flight Communications
Communications between pilots in the same flight are referred to inter-flight communications. 
	Inter-flight communications need to be clear and concise.
At times you may be able to have a relaxed radio traffic, however things can quickly change and need to become very concise and controlled quickly.
When you have two radios, a back seater, RWR noises, and you are trying to fly to avoid threats, all this combines to create what we call “Helmet Fire”. Even if you are currently flying in a clear and comfortable environment, it is possible that at least one person you are in communication with over the radio is dealing with a complicated situation. Be mindful of this when you are transmitting!
	Inter-flight communication follows the same, “A, this is B, where is C” format we discussed earlier.
	In this flight your Instructor Pilot (IP) will handle most radio communications, however it is still important for you to communicate with your IP.

### Radio Check-in
One of the first conversations you will have with the IP over the radio, is a check in. It will go something like this:
	Check in with Flight Lead:
	> TALON FLIGHT, TALON 1, Check in
	> TALON 1, TALON 2, Green Jet, Fuel 3 point 9
Lets break that down, 
- First Flight lead asks for a check in, identifying who they are talking to, and who they are.
- DASH 2, callsign TALON 2, replies that they have a green jet. This means the jet is started up, checklists completed, and there are no warning or caution lights.
- DASH 2 then gives their fuel state, this informs the flight lead, and helps them manage the flight. Fuel state is read off in thousands followed by a point and hundreds. 3900lbs of fuel would be read as, “Three point nine”.
