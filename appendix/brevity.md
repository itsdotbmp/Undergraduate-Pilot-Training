Standardized Brevity Words and meanings

This section is used to define terms used on the radio. This list is by no means exhaustive and many terms may not be relative to a units mission. The purpose is to establish a common vocabulary for pilots and mission designers.  (Note: Maybe this section goes in another document?)
